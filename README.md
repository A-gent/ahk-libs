# ahk-libs
All the (redistributable) AHK libs I can find...

Licenses are scattered around in there somewhere.

At the moment, this repo contains well over 200 libraries, classes, and
wrappers for AHK basic (vanilla), AHK\_L, and AHK v2, implemented in over
2900 ahk scripts.

## AutoHotkey Library distribution
Want more libs? Several projects have similar goals to this one:

* [pAHKlite](https://github.com/hi5/pAHKlight)
* [package/stdlib distribution and management](https://trello.com/b/XVP4M76d/package-stdlib-distribution-and-management)
  from the [ahkscript](https://github.com/ahkscript) folks
* [ALD](http://libba.net/) (discontinued)
* tuncay's original [ahkstdlib](http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=54996)

## README!
Please note that, because this repo makes heavy use of git 'submodules',
downloading a zip or tarball is not useful. Instead, if you wish to have
access to all the libs included in this repo, please run:

    git clone --recursive git://github.com/george2/ahk-libs.git
