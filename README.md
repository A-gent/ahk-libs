# ahk-libs
All the (redistributable) AHK libs I can find...

Licenses are scattered around in there somewhere.

At the moment, this repo contains well over 200 libraries, classes, and
wrappers for AHK basic (vanilla), AHK\_L, and AHK v2, implemented in over
2900 ahk scripts.

## README!
Please note that, because this repo makes heavy use of git 'submodules',
downloading a zip or tarball is not useful. Instead, if you wish to have
access to all the libs included in this repo, please run:

    git clone git://github.com/george2/ahk-libs.git
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    git submodule update --remote --merge
